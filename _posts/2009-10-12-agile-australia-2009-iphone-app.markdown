I have been working as part of a team at ThoughtWorks to build an iPhone app for the upcoming Agile Australia 2009 conference. It has been an anxious wait for Apple to approve the app, but it was a thrill when that email finally came through. I am pleased to announce that the [Agile Australia 2009 iphone app](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=333723252&mt=8) is now available for download at the iTunes store for free! If you are attending the conference then this companion app will keep you informed of the schedule, provide feedback, follow the hot sessions, find your rooms, and tweet about the talks.
