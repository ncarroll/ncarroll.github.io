Iâ€™m heading to Singapore next week for a holiday with my partner Kimmy. Unfortunately Kimmy is heading to Singapore for work, so I have had to find things to do to keep myself entertained during the day. I could have been content with heading to the Raffles hotel and knocking back a few Singapore Slings, but I did one better and organised to give a presentation at the Singapore Java Meetup at a microbrewery and restaurant called [Brewerkz](http://www.brewerkz.com/). I will be presenting on Agile, Mingle, and working through a Test Driven Development exercise with the group. The event will be sponsored by ThoughtWorks and it is already booked solid. Goes to show that you have to get in quick when free beer is on offer!

Update: My presentation is available online as a [Google Doc](http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dhk3jdgh_1hdgb3g).
