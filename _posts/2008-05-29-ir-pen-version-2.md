My previous attempt at building a [simple IR pen]({{ site.url }}/2008/05/26/simple-ir-pen-for-wiimote-whiteboard) did not work as expected. The power source was too weak for the IR LED, and consequently the Wiimote had difficulty detecting the IR light.

For my second attempt I purchased an IR LED, some wire, a momentary switch, a 10 Ohm resistor, and a battery holder for two AA batteries. I also had a whiteboard marker lying around, which I used to create the casing for the IR pen.

I wired up the circuit so that the IR LED was in serial with the switch, resistor and battery holder. I then cut off the nozzle from the whiteboard marker casing. I needed space to fit the switch, so I cut the cylinder shaped casing in half, and drilled a hole to push the switch through. I then popped the LED through the nozzle, and wrapped the casing around the circuit. Everything was then held in place using electrical tape. It was a prototype, so I didnâ€™t bother with aesthetics, which the rubber band holding the pen and battery holder together clearly shows.

I am glad to report that this particular IR pen works perfectly with my laptop screen and the Wiimote. However, I will need to test it out on a projected image from a data projector before officially giving the thumbs up.
