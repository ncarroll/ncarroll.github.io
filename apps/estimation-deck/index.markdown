[Estimation Deck](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/estimation-deck/id506612646?ls=1&mt=8) provides a set of fibonacci numbers that can be used during an Agile estimation session.

This application allows the Agile professional to swipe through the deck of cards until the desired estimate is found for the proposed story. Tapping on the estimate card will flip the card to hide your estimate from your colleagues. Tapping the back of the card will flip the card again to reveal your estimate to the group.

Use the settings to switch between Fibonacci, T-Shirt Sizes, and Powers of 2 decks.
